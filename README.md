# Specification

The app aims to solve the problem of the user who wants to find a circular route for outdoor activities (walking, cycling, hiking).
The user can view the map and search for routes without logging in, either circular routes, or routes between a start and end point. Different activity types can be selected, and the result can be randomised.
Once the user is logged in, favourite routes can be saved in _My Routes_ and can be viewed on the map, or they can be removed from the list.

# Tech Stack:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) for the front end
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for the backend (Firestore and Authentication)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing
- [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) for test coverage
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for mapping
- [Location IQ API](https://locationiq.com/) for converting user input locations to geographic coordinates
- [Open Route Service API](https://openrouteservice.org/) for route planning
- [GraphHopper API](https://www.graphhopper.com/) for map controller
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) & CSS for styling

# Development Process

Our team used an agile development process with regular sprints to deliver this application.
We followed the Extreme Programming values - all features were pair programmed, team members shared all the changes in the code design, the team used test-driven development, and delivered an MVP in the first sprint.
During development we used an agile process of git branches, merges, regular code reviews, and continuous integration.
We had daily stand-ups and retrospectives to update each other on the tasks completed, and reflect on our team's progress.

## Initial planning

We agreed to create an app that can be used to search for routes with the main focus on finding circular routes.
This is an actual problem we faced when we tried to plan routes for cycling or walking, as it is currently not possible to plan circular routes on other web mapping services without providing multiple waypoints.
We knew we wanted to have a React frontend, and the majority of the app will be on the frontend, but we also needed a light backend and decided to go for Firebase.
We created mockups and diagrams to visualise the MVP and the flow of information within the app.

## MVP

Our aim for the MVP was to have an interface with a map, and a form where the user can input a start and end point, these points get converted to geographic coordinates and the route displayed on the map. We achieved this by the end of the first 2-day sprint.

## Adding features to MVP

With a working MVP we moved on and decided to add a database where the user can save routes.
We also setup authentication to the app with Firebase.

# Further development

We are planning to extend the app with extra features:

- show user's location in realtime
- add friends & be able to see their saved routes
- make it into a mobile app
